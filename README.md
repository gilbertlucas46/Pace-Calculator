# Pace Calculator

## Brief
Using **Vue**, **React** or any other modern JavaScript frameworks, create an online pace calculator that allows runners measure their pace.

In your app, a user should be able to:
- Type in any 2 of the 3 (**time**, **distance**, and **pace**) parameters and see the 3rd value automatically calculated using the forumula `pace = time / distance`. Values should be calculated live. User should not need to press any buttons for the calculations to occur. 
- Switch between **metric** (i.e. meters, km / min, etc.) and **imperial** (i.e. miles, miles / min, etc.) units.
- See how fast she'd be able to finish a **5km**, a **10km**, a **half marathon** (21.0975km), and a **full marathon** (42.195km) *besides* the distance she selects.  

While you're free to use CSS frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind, etc.) as a foundation, you are expected to write **custom styles** to build the apperance of your app. You may use **SASS**, **LESS**, **PostCSS** or any other tooling as you see fit. 

## Example
Here are few examples of similar tools:   
https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/pace   
https://www.strava.com/running-pace-calculator   
https://exerciseinstitute.com.au/pace-calculator/   

Your implementation does not have to follow the examples. Your final work is expected to present a sigificantly better user experience. 

## Timeline
This project is expected to take **1 week** to complete. Please do inform me in advance if you require additional time. 

## Evaluation Criteria
Once we receive your work, we'll evaluate it based on:
- The error-free functionality of your work. 
- The quality of your code. 
- The appearance and the UX quality of the end product (although you're not required to possess the full skill set of a UX designer for this position, your design sense and ability to make small design decisions adds significant value to your work).

## Note:
Please deploy it somewhere we can test
